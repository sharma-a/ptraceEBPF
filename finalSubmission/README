Q2)
I did the secfile part for this question.
to compile do gcc -o secfile secfile.c
to run do ./secfile password command args
password is a string 
I did it using PTRACE_TRACEME and hence it works without needing sudo.
Forks cant be handled properly using TRACEME option so I did not do that.
I tried doing the forks using the PTRACE_ATTACH option and I have attached in implementation as secfile_attachFork.c.
This has to be run as root.
But the PTRACE_ATTACH option was showing strange non-deterministic behaviour. I spent a lot of time investigating the issue and made lots of tests but could not resolve the issue.





Q3)
part 1: forbids executing /bin/nc
NOTE: in the provided VM just doing nc runs /usr/bin/nc and not /bin/nc and that is not forbidden. To test this try running /bin/nc directly.
part 2: the blocked IP is the one provided in the question (192.168.125.125)
past 3: the full file path is printed if the path lies inside the /home/sekar directory. Otherwise only the filename is printed. This is because of the get_filename_from_inode function provided to us works by doing a find on a specified path and specifying the root path is inefficient so I just specify /home/sekar.
